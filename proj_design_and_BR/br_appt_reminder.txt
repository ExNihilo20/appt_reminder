Business Rules for Appt Reminder

Goal: As a music teacher, I want an appointment reminder that reminds students the day before of their upcoming lesson. I want it to be able to send a message to their cellphone, and I want it to be able to both receive a response, and store the sent message/received response for historical purposes.

Requirements
1. Send push notifications to students reminding them of upcoming lessons.

2. Receive replies from students for historical purposes.

3. Give students a way to opt out of receiving messages with this system.

4. The system must be automated so I am not manually doing this work. Ideally, it would be set around a scheduled release.


Business Rules
1. Push notifications must go out the morning before a drum lesson at 10AM local time.

2. Students must only receive a single reminder of their upcoming music lesson.

3. Push notifications must be stored for historical purposes.

4. Students must be able to send a simple code to opt out of the messages.

5. I must use systemd or cron to schedule the job so that any Linux machine (including a Docker container) can run the operation.

6. Must use database to store:
  6.a. student profiles
  6.b. sent messages
  6.c. reply messages

Flow for app
1. send student notification of upcoming lesson.
2. store their reply (if they reply)
